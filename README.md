### Mock Login Data for User and Admin:

For General User:
    Email : dgpatel@gmail.com
    password : darshan123

For Admin User:
    Email:darshan@gmail.com
    password : darshan123


### In this project for security purpose i used JWT tocken for login of user.

By this i will ensure security of users confidential data. 

This is frontend project so i used mock data but i also implemented this with actual backend and i made robust system with security so that anyone can not see password of any user in database also. 

In database also , password stored in hash format.
